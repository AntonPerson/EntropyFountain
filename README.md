# Entropy Fountain
> "True randomness is like someone shuffling a deck of cards while skydiving. You never know what you're going to get, and it's a wild ride."

![A very beautiful and picturesque unique fountain of truly random numbers as seen by a true artist in the purest sense of bliss.](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/assets/EntropyFountain.png?raw=true "An autogenerated image of a fountain by Stable Diffusion")

### The Entropy Conundrum
As the torchbearers of ingenuity, we are faced with an intriguing problem: the [system-level entropy](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/assets/system_entropy_seed/system_trng.c), painstakingly concocted in the domesticated abode of computation, falters in its ability to scale with grace. Our thirst for copious and diverse nonces remains unquenched.


With the alchemist's curiosity, we may labor to craft a compendium of random data through the archaic means of manual conjuration.

### Delving into the Pictorial Realm of Noise
Let us commence by turning our gazes upon the enigmatic CMOS sensor nestled within the confines of a laptop's camera. This minstrel of electrical activity sings a cacophony of noise under the right incantations. In this instance, I beckoned to the sensor with a white parchment enveloped in twilight, brought about by dimming the lantern behind my computational grimoire and leaving a mere sliver of lightâ€™s passage.

A noble encoding ritual banishes the mundane, and not-so-random whispers, leaving behind the rich tapestry of randomness, best stored in the form of an artifact known as the "lossy jpg" rather than the stolid bitmap.

Behold, the chosen emissaries of chaos:
### Emissary One ![Emissary One](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/raw/photo1.jpg?raw=true "Raw photo number 1")
### Emissary Two ![Emissary Two](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/raw/photo2.jpg?raw=true "Raw photo number 2")

Plucked from a cauldron of twenty, these images are the epitome of captured entropy.

### A Symphony of Sounds: When Silence Whispers Randomness
Turn now, we must, to the audible realm. A laptop's fan, under the hush of silence, wields the wand of noise. But, does it bear the true essence of randomness? Let your senses be the judge through this captured echo of the ancients:
![Captured Echo](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/raw/noise.jpg?raw=true "A green noisy picture, but it clearly shows some structures that are easy to identify as not very random") (A lament, this echo was found wanting and cast aside).

A more enchanting method would be to call forth the spirits of randomness through the cacophony of keystrokes, mouse clicks, or the rhythmic beats of ancient percussion instruments.

Harken to these recitations:

- [Recitation Beta](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/raw/sound2.m4a)

Eight such harmonies were bestowed upon this tapestry.

### The Alchemy of Optimization
The pilgrimage towards True Randomness is far from complete. Through the looking glass of our collected pictorial and audible fragments, one discerns the delicate noise and shadows.

The Canny edge detection, a wizardry of image alchemy, is a faithful companion in this pursuit. With tender settings, it unveils the hidden whispers of noise. I implore you to delve into this modest incantation etched in the sacred Rust script:

As your eyes traverse the inverted relics, you may behold patterns reminiscent of the enigmatic QR runes:
### Inverted Relic One ![Inverted Relic One](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/photo1.jpg?raw=true)
### Inverted Relic Two ![Inverted Relic Two](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/photo2.jpg?raw=true)

Our symphonies of sound, too, may transcend the realm of the audible and reincarnate as pictorial echoes. Through hex-sorcery, they are reborn as images, and the Canny wizardry may once again dance upon their surfaces:
### Sound Transmuted One ![Sound Transmuted One](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/sound1.jpg?raw=true)
### Sound Transmuted Two ![Sound Transmuted Two](https://github.com/AntonPerson/EntropyFountain/blob/main/data/sound2.jpg?raw=true)

Finally, we invoke the sacred XOR to banish echoes and redundancies. Yet, our offerings must be further refined through the ancient rite of the von Neumann Extractor. This exalted ritual transmutes the raw, entropic ether into a finely-honed and purified substance worthy of our Quest for True Randomness.

As guardians of this sacred knowledge, we partake only in the essence we need and consign the excess to the cosmic winds.
